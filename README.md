# Generative Adversarial Model (GAN)

This repository implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**, a deep learning framework that consists of two neural networks — the generator and the discriminator — competing against each other to improve their respective performances. GANs are widely used in generating synthetic data, such as images, based on real data distributions.

## Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning frameworks introduced by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. The primary goal of a GAN is to generate new data instances that resemble the training data.

- **Generator:** Creates fake data that tries to mimic real data.
- **Discriminator:** Classifies data as real or fake (generated).

The GAN model uses adversarial training: the generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to correctly distinguish between real and generated data. Over time, both networks improve and generate high-quality data.

## Features

- **Customizable architecture:** Easily modify the generator and discriminator networks.
- **Flexible Training:** Works with various datasets, including images, text, and other data types.
- **Pretrained Models:** Includes pretrained models for quick experimentation.
- **Image Generation:** Includes functionality to generate synthetic images.
- **Easy-to-use CLI:** Command line interface for quick training and evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.0+ or PyTorch 1.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional for image processing)
- Other dependencies can be installed via `requirements.txt`.

## Results
After training, you will find the following outputs:

Generated Images: Stored in the output/ directory.
Model Checkpoints: Saved during training in the models/ directory.
Logs: Training logs stored in logs/ for monitoring loss metrics.
